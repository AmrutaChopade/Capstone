File-1 Descriptive Statistics Instaart: This PPT contains descriptive statistics performed on different datasets to find insights using Tableau.

File-2 Apriori Instacart: This file involves working with the Apriori's theorem which is a common market basket analysis theorem. It predicts the likelihood of items bought together. For example Bread and Butter go together etc.

File-3 Instacart FeatureXG: This file is based on XG-Boost and LGBM. Both of these are used to improve the accuracy of the model and I have concluded that LGBM is slightly more accurate than XG-Boost in this case.
